"Table S5. Related to Figure 2. Pairwise interactions in the Plasmodium protein interaction network. The table includes scores for all the features used in the random forest classifier, in addition to other useful information, such as annotation in interaction databases for human, mouse, worm and fly orthologs, and whether the interaction pair has biochemical evidence (blue native fractionation) from only one Plasmodium species. This table can be used to import the protein interaction pairs together with attributes of the interaction (edge attributes) into network visualisation programs."
